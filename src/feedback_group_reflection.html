              <p>
                Mai: Mai is a thoughtful and responsible friend in everything. She always knows how to help everyone on the team and lead a team, especially Mai's ability to write essays in English most outstanding. Working with her in the past two assignments, I find her is a person that is very patient and listens to others. Therefore, I like to talk to her only in work, but also other things.
                <br/><br/>
                Quyen: Since my guiding on Github's last assignment, everyone in the team now is more familiar with using Github. Therefore, they can now perform it correctly and clearly. I feel a bit proud of that. However, it is hard to give up my hot-tempered, so I find it still not easy for everyone to get along with me.
                <br/><br/>
                Loi: Loi always respects everyone's opinion and is responsible for the job. Last assignment, he was still not good at using English to express his ideas. However, in this assignment, his English has a massive improvement. He now can professionally perform the writing.
                <br/><br/>
                Long: Long is still a person that is most easy to get along. He is responsible and dedicates to the work. He seemed not very active in giving ideas in the last assignment. However, I find him more actively contributing his opinions to the project.
              </p>

              <h4 class="entry-title">From Mai</h4>
              <p>
                Mai: I have learned a lot about one of the convolutional neural networks, a branch of deep learning in machine learning. In this Assignment 3, I have controlled my emotions better and stop spamming our group chat on Messenger. I have learned to communicate with my teammates and graciously talk to them on how to improve their works. Overall, I believe that I have collaborated with my teammates much better in this Assignment than in the previous assignment.
                <br/><br/>
                Quyen: Ms. Quyen has many experiences in the field of IT and she has shared with us the usual process of creating a mobile application which is very precious. Once again, she is the one who sets up the repository on GitHub for us to collaborate as well. Her dedication and enthusiasm to explain new ideas to us are much appreciated as well.
                <br/><br/>
                Loi: Loi has made progress this Assignment. He did take responsibility for his works by discussing his works with the team, doing more research about our app's competitors, and never skipped any group meetings. Although his English writing skills still need some improvements, I am much appreciative of his attitude when working in the team in this Assignment.
                <br/><br/>
                Long: He did try to communicate with us anytime there are problems with his tasks.  Although he is older than me but he was always welcomed my opinions on his work and willing to modify it if needed. His open-mindedness is very precious and much obliged!

              <p>
                Mai: Mai is a responsible person, and has a tendency to live in haste. Although she knows how to help the other members, she is also putting a little pressure on the team to lead. Even so, I respect the way she guides and helps the member as she just wants to fulfill her role within the group.
                <br/><br/>
                Quyen: Ms. Quyen has a lot of IT experience and she has guided our team a lot in collaborating through Git and GitHub as well as sharing work environment experience. That made me feel more respect for her and learn more from the seniors.
                <br/><br/>
                Loi: I 'm a bit satisfied with my progress in this assignment now.  It's true that although I also have many shortcomings, but thanks to the time I work with the group, I have slowly tried to overcome my weaknesses through exchanging ideas. At the same time, I also explore new things that are beyond understanding in the current technology age for new ideas.
                <br/><br/>
                Long: Long is an easygoing person and very responsible at work. He always respects others' opinions, and always completes the group 's assigned parts. At the same time he has a lot of good ideas to consider and expand although he was a bit confused when recieving comments from other.
              </p>

              <p>
                Mai: Mai is a good leader in the team that she alway wants to help me with at all times. She remained every person in the group like a best leader and moreover she alway took care and listened to the ideas of all of us. Moreover, she helped me in writing the essay too much, because I am not good as English grammar and interesting vocabulary. The best leader (with me).
                <br/><br/>
                Quyen: Quyen is an expert person in our team. She is very nice and has a lot of knowledge in the IT field. Moreover, she is the first person ideas of the team. She is very creative and smart and she alway gives us more ideas when we do not know what we can do now and we just work for Quyen ideas. In addition, she teaches us how to use github and create a web site that is easier to understand. She is the best friend(teacher) I ever know.
                <br/><br/>
                Loi: Loi is a good person that he alway finishes before me. He and I have more knowledge in IT than me. He is a hard worker that tries to do everything better. Moreover, he is not just working with me in IIT that he is working with me in Math and he teaches me a lot in Math because I am not really understanding Math.
                <br/><br/>
                Long: I have less knowledge in this assignment because it tries to do more deeper in our project ideas. But I just try to understand and learn more from my team to do this assignment more better.

                For My own Perception: I think I have done a great job in completing the assigned work, besides I like to help the team members complete their work. However, my hot-tempered and conservative nature needs to be improved to make it easier to get along with everyone. I noticed that everyone was quite surprised by my ability to code the web and use GitHub. I learned a lot from everyone in the team, but what I like the most is the careful, thoughtful, and thoroughness in everything.
                <br/><br/>
                For Group: I feel fortunate to be able to work with all of my team members. We have completed the assigned work meticulously and responsibly. Everyone divided the job fairly and completed it on time. No one is absent from the group's meetings. However, since the last assignment, we could not find any time to meet offline because of the COVID and individual's timeline. Although we are meeting online most of the time, everyone still finishes the job correctly, and we are happy to work together. My team now can maximize the Github's advantage not only for this project but also for the real working life.

                For me: in this assignment I tried more because it is more deeper and harder than the last. But thanks to my group that I learned more from them. I tried to complete my work with my experience and what I learned from my group. I learned more in working with GitHub and the web from Quyen, being a good leader from Mai and hard worker from Loi.
                <br/><br/>
                For group: I repeat it one more time that I am working in the best group ever I worked before. One is the best leader that she can push the work on going well and help every person in the team to do the assignment more better. Second is the expert person that I have nothing to talk about because she gives us the ideas and how to do it. The third is to help me with a lot of work not just in IT. This group is an awesome group and everyone is very friendly. I have no ideas to talk about this group. I very much respect this group. Thank you all.
              <h4 class="entry-title">From Mai</h4>
              <p>
                For My own Perception: Overall, I am quite proud of what I did in this assessment. I have learned many new things from doing the research as well as my teammates. Nevertheless, I believe that I should be calmer when dealing with my team members so that I do not hurt them but the workflow can still be controlled at it best as well.
                <br/><br/>
                For Group: As a business student, it is very interesting for me to join a group of all members whose majors are IT or engineering. I have discovered that their way of thinking differs from mine a lot. I am also grateful of Ms. Quyen for showing and sharing with me a lot of amazing experiences she has on her career path. However, because most of the members do not really familiarize with GitHub so that our work is adjusted mostly on Google Drive, it is still not smooth and convenient as much, in my opinion. Notwithstanding, I hope that after this assignment, when we have gained more knowledge about how to use a powerful such as GitHub, our collaboration will be better.
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">From Loi</h4>
              <p>
                For My own Perception: From my personal opinion, I am satisfied with my own work progress in this post compared to the previous post. Because I have been assigned to do the first part as well as the part I am confident to complete. At the same time, I am satisfied with the arrangement of the group time so that I can talk and exchange information. Therefore, I affirm that I have learned many things through the group members as well as the experience of the predecessor.
                <br/><br/>
                For Team: I feel lucky to be able to work with all of my team members. At the same time I was also surprised that the progress of this exam was faster compared to the previous period although this exam was more difficult because of the deeper study area. Moreover, I also hope that when the group finishes their part, please notify in advance so that there is time to edit. But do not let the last time and call for adjustment, it will take time and affect the time that I have set.
