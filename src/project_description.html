              <!-- Loi: Overview -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Overview (Loi)</h2>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Topic</h4>
              <p>
                Our project - PLOME - will be an AI mobile app for growing food at home. When opening this app, users can specify the type of plants that they like and the app will evaluate the suitability of the chosen plants with the weather conditions of the user’s location. Subsequently, it will provide users with instructions on how to take care of their plants step-by-step, and push notifications for reminding users to keep an eye on their plants. This app will also have a social media platform called Home Grow Community for users to post their planting processes, share their experiences or even trade their products with each other.
                <br/><br/>
                With the help of our app, people can take advantage of the free space in the house such as the veranda, or the balcony, for planting trees. Planting at home can help reduce the use of pesticides or other detrimental chemicals and thus enhance the food security as well. Not only benefit those who enjoy planting and want to spend their leisure time on planting activities, especially in the context of pandemic nowadays, this app can contribute to the construction of a more sustainable and resilient food system in mega cities whose growing demand for food can pose great burden on food affordability and availabiltiy.
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Motivation</h4>
              <h5 class="entry-title">a. Our story</h5>
              <p>
                As we all know, the world is fighting against the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Consequently, growing vegetables at home has been done by households around the world in the course of implementing social barriers or social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Moreover, due to food pollution and residues of pesticides, chemical fertilizers in today's agricultural products, many people now do not know how to choose clean vegetables and fruits to protect their health and family. In order to support this need for clean vegetables or making a green space in their own home, we thought of doing this task to help individuals how to plant their trees in a viable way, by which they would build enthusiasm for agriculture, improve the well-being and protect the environment. In addition, they will be able to make a profit by selling their own plants, vegetables, fruits, and having a more sustainable financial resource in the future.
              </p>
              <h5 class="entry-title">b. Fitness with current IT trends</h5>
              <p>
              We will apply machine learning, particularly the convolutional neural network, to identify the type of trees which users want to plant and based on such images provided by users to make the guidance for them on how to take care of their plants. In recent years, deep CNN has been utilized a lot to enhance the accuracy and to reduce the number of parameters needed by applying squeeze architecture (Elhassouny & Smarandache 2019). The applications of CNN include facial recognition, document analysis, collection of historical and environmental data, fuzzy logic (which sees the world as a “grey” area with neither true nor false statements) or consumer behavior analysis (Flatworld Solutions n.d.).
              </p>
              <h5 class="entry-title">c. Market research</h5>
              <p>
                In America, more and more young people are engaged in home gardening. In a report published by the National Gardening Association (NGA) in 2014, 35% of American households (42 million) grew their food from home, increasing by 17% since 2008. The spending on gardening has also risen by 40% within 5 years.
                <br/><br/>
                Moreover, in the era of COVID-19, the demand for home gardening has elevated due to the disruption in the food supply chain (Lal 2020), the fear of consumers to go to crowded places such as grocery stores (Sailor 2020), and also the reduction in income and rise in leisure time have motivated households to grow their food from home (Sailor 2020).
                <br/><br/>
                On top of that, there are many problems arising when growing food from home, especially the climatic conditions such as light, water, soil, temperature, and so on ((Missouri Botanical Garden n.d.). Therefore, novice home gardeners have to seek advice from experts and farmers on the Internet (Sailor 2020).
                <br/><br/>
                It is important to understand that this trend of home gardening will not only thrive in the pandemic. Firstly, it will become a type of hobby to reduce stress (Scott 2019). Also, the growing needs for food security as well as the boom in demand for organic food thanks to health-conscious citizens will also play an important role in making more and more people want to plant their trees at home. Indeed, the CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of organic food markets in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific has seen significant improvement since 2015 (Market Research 2019, cited in Chokhani 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                Furthermore, in many countries, people from high-income class also pay attention to the impact of their buying behavior on the social equity and the well-being of other communities in the society. Hence, there has been a rising demand for “local food and short value chains with direct contact with producers, including those who provide food through e-commerce (i.e. first-hand traceability)” among this group of consumers in recent years (Tefft et al. 2017, p. 15). All of these will be a good foundation to guarantee the success of our project.
              </p>
              <h5 class="entry-title">d. For future employer</h5>
              <p>
                Food issues, as well as environmental issues, are becoming very sensitive issues at the moment when both of these issues have a major impact on human life and this green planet is losing life. The creation of green applications, environmental technologies that help reduce environmental problems and clean food are now being encouraged by many environmental charity organizations and companies. This can bring many significant benefits when investing properly in the promotion and development of green technologies for the human well-being of the living environment.

               <p>
                 In Vietnam, similar products which apply technology to assist users in growing their own plants are the hydroponic vegetable growing system project, which operates automatically via smartphones for students and staff of the Vinh Long University of Technical Education and has won the first prize at the Tran Dai Nghia Technical Innovation Contest 2018-2019 (Đảm, 2020) andthe hydroponic vegetable growing system project through the smartphone application of a group of 6 university students that won the third prize in the "Danang Runway Startup 2016" start-up idea contest (Hương, 2016). These two smartphones are all for the hydroponic planting system. The Gardroid application created by Dimitri De Kerf is another mobile application which provides users tips and guidelines on how to make a beautiful kitchen garden.

                  The difference of our project is that we use artificial intelligence to process information in our applications. Secondly, our app applies to all types of household planting, not just hydroponic planting systems, and therefore it can only provide guidance for users to plant their trees, not automate the entire process of irrigation or fertilization in the above-mentioned applications, which must be carried out with the sensors attached to the hydroponic system. Last but not least, with this app, users can share the experience of planting, trade their products, give advice to newbies, and ask questions from knowledgeable practitioners or crop experts to improve their planting journey.
                </p>
              <!-- Loi: Aims -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Aims (Loi)</h2>
              <p>
                Our aim for this intended application is to help users grow and harvest plants at home easily and conveniently on the basis of fresh fruit and vegetables information and techniques for a clean food source or have a nice view of the garden, and also indirect for environmental protection. We want to help people have clean, safe food and avoid external agents such as chemicals and pests. But in order to achieve this, we need to break down a lot of small goals which will be explained in more detail below.
                <br/><br/>
                First, we will gather data on the 1000 most popular gardening crops and start a training model based on this data. Also, we will collect data of the corresponding weather conditions and the growth timeline of these crops in order to assess the suitability of the user’s location with the growth of the selected crops. Next, we will collect weather data of the 5 states in the US which have seen the greatest interest in home gardening over the past 5 years: Oregon, Kansas, Oklahoma, Ohio, and Montana (Google Trends 2020).
                <br/><br/>
                Second, we want to create a simple, easy-to-use application that will be evaluated through a testing process in order to avoid being too simple or too fussy. After that, we will open an early access version for users to experience first and to be able to provide feedback. From it,  we'll adjust, fix bugs, and update new changes before the application officially opens. And finally, we set the goal to reach 5000 downloads for this app after the release of the official version in order to create a network that is large enough for users to share their planting tips and products together as well as to deploy the gardening utensils recommendation features.

              <!-- Mai: Plans and Progress -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Plans and Progress (Mai)</h2>

              <!-- Quyen: Roles -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Roles (Quyen)</h2>
              <p>
                It is important to define roles for particular participants in a project. The key to justifying a position is to demonstrate what task or responsibility is being covered. We have explicitly defined several works for the project, depending not only on the project's needs over each stage, but also on each team member's existing abilities, personality, and desired job.
                <br/><br/>
                • Project Management (Quyen): This position plays a crucial responsibility in the project, which is more tactical and strategic, focusing primarily on the execution side. In this project, we are expecting this position is not only holding three main activities, which are defined as risk and issue management, planning and resource scheduling, scope management. But also know how to set the vision for the product, gather requirements, and prioritize them. Quyen's current job is a web developer and a Project Management trainee. Moreover, Quyen's desired job is Technical Project Management, so we think it would be suitable for her to take the position.
                <br/><br/>
                • Business Analysis (Mai): The job is to work directly with users to determine problems and identify the user's needs. They work closely with the team to deliver user's perspectives and recommend viable solutions for meeting those needs. For this project, they are also required to handle user testing and the app's marketing. Mai wants to be a Business Analyst in the future. She has studied and has been in contact with marketing a lot. Therefore, Mai's ability to communicate with customers stands out the most in the group. Mai's personality is also meticulous and detailed. So the Business Analyst position is very suitable for Mai to undertake.
                <br/><br/>
                • Loi and Long have many outstanding personalities such as friendly, responsible, and dedicated to their work. However, for this project, Loi and Long may not be skilled enough to solve the project's technology-related problems as they seem to have only finished about one to two semesters at school, and have not learned or had practical contact with skills such as code in the web, mobile app or data, etc. Furthermore, Loi's ideal job is IT Security Analyst, so Loi may not commit to a project that requires development to last several years. Long's preferred position is Software development. Although he cannot directly participate in the tech parts of the product, this will be a perfect opportunity to interact with real projects and understand all the essential factors for a technology product to be born. We see that Long and Loi will be very suitable to accompany the project in tasks such as observing, researching, contributing ideas to the product team, and managing user testing.
                <br/><br/>
                Due to the complexity and the needs of the project, we expect to hire the following positions:
                <br/><br/>
                • Chief Technology Officer (CTO): The position is considered one of the most substantial technical knowledge for front-end, back-end, and AI. The CTO is responsible for maintaining the project's strategic logic focus and is in charge of turning a concept into reality. They manage the tech team and make business-critical tech decisions, such as tech design planning, product architecture layout, and development platform selection. If a tech team does not have the knowledge or resources to complete a task, it is down to the CTO to find a solution.
                <br/><br/>
                • UX, UI Designer: The project's primary purpose is to provide clear and beautiful guidance for users to grow their plants at home. It requires a UX designer to ensure a product makes sense to the user by creating a path that logically flows from one step to the next. A UI designer ensures each page visually communicates that path. They need to work closely with the product team, especially with the product analysis, to understand the users' needs and solve problems.
                <br/><br/>
                • Data Processing: This app is running mainly on AI. Therefore, it is essential to collect a massive amount of data and convert it into usable information. They are responsible for researching reliable data sources, crawling data from the authorities, and cleaning the data before sending it to the data scientist.
                <br/><br/>
                • Data Scientist: They communicate and collaborate with both the product team and the tech team. They must stay on top of analytical techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and text analytics. Using data from the data processing, they will build and run all data-driven models that solve the app's problems and finalize all API needed for mobile integration.
                <br/><br/>
                • Mobile Developer: They are required to build the app on both Android and IOS. They work closely with the back-end, the data scientist, and the product team to ensure all features work well.
                <br/><br/>
                • Back-end Developer: They are responsible for server-side development. They help to manage all activities that happen when performing any action on the app. Back-end developer focuses on databases, scripting, and the architecture of the app. The code written by them helps to communicate the database information. Specifically, they will build the store of data (plants database, user planting process, etc.) and ensure that it is displayed to that user who is supposed to access it. They manage API's resources that are needed for others.
                <br/><br/>
                • Technical Tester: They work as part of a development team and perform the functional and non-functional testing of the project using manual and automated testing techniques. They identify test conditions and create test designs, test cases, test procedure specifications, and test data. Finally, they provide reports to the project team about any issues or improvements that the product may require.

              <p>There are three stages for us to put into the production test.</p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 1</h4>
              <p>
                At this stage, we focus mainly on software testing technologies. A technical examiner or QA does most of the work at this stage. They will plan and execute software testing through six steps of the software testing process.
                <br/>
                • Step 1: <b>Analyzing requirements:</b> This step needs to research and analyze the requirements of the project
                <br/>
                • Step 2: <b>Test plan:</b> This step needs to define the scope of the project, determine the approach, identify resources, plan the design work test.
                <br/>
                • Step 3: <b>Develop test cases:</b> Review documents, write test cases, checklists, test prepare data, review test cases, checklists.
                <br/>
                • Step 4: <b>Setting up the environment:</b> Set up a test environment (server/client/network), check the test environment by smoke test.
                <br/>
                • Step 5: <b>Perform a test:</b> Perform a software test, Compare the expected results, and report the errors with the error management tool. Perform a check again to verify the error has been fixed. And regression testing when relevant changes. Measure and analyze progress. Adjust project documents according to the actual progress of the project. Report regularly to the Project Manager on the project implementation situation.
                <br/>
                • Step 6: <b>Test cycle closure:</b> Summarize, report results on test case execution. Evaluate fulfillment criteria such as testing scope, quality, cost, time, and critical business goals. Discuss and draw lessons from experience.
                <br/>
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 2</h4>
              <p>Focus primarily on internal testing. After the QA completes their testing, a mock-up product will be released, asking everyone in the product team, including PM, to install and test their device's mock-up version. QA collects all error feedback that is claimed from the PM and product team. Then review the bug, report it to developers to make corrections. </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 3</h4>
              <p>This is the phase that focuses mainly on user testing. BA and the product team mostly complete the works at this stage. They will provide methods to engage users in the use of the test products. There are many ways to gather users like seeding into the Facebook group for home care, growing trees at home such as "Yeu Bep," "Nghien Nha" etc. Target customers are between the ages of 20 and 50 who love planting trees and taking care of their families. Create a Facebook community to communicate and support users. Run advertising applications on the media. Organize seminars on new technologies applied in products to attract students and people who love AI technology applications. BA needs to collect, analyze, and report on user opinions.</p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">How We Know When The Product Succeed</h4>
              <p>Additionally, we will know the product's success if the feedback results from the user testing (at least 1000 users) is more than 90% of users are happy using the app. Moreover, we will collect and analyze the application report from the google analytics (we will integrate the google analytics to the app since the stage of launching. Google analytics is a great tool integrated for an application which allows us to know how many users are using the app, what stage that users are leaving the app, and providing actionable insights, ect.). Therefore, from those reports, we might have the efficient data to consider customizing the app to make the product more user friendly.</p>

              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Group Processes and Communications (Quyen)</h2>
              <p>
                It is common for everyone to work together in small groups, teams, and departments to accomplish specific tasks in a university environment and real working life. To work effectively with one another, each individual needs to have strong group communication skills. If they don't, the team members may cause misunderstandings, start unnecessary conflicts, and slow down a team's effectiveness. A plan to facilitate effective group communication can help everyone work better together. Therefore, below is our agreement in the group processes and the way we communicate with each other.
                <br/><br/>
                Trello is an excellent tool for teamwork management. Looking at the Trello board, members will quickly grasp the work progress of themselves and all members of the team. Trello allows users to create work notes on each card, helping the project managers manage and assign tasks to each member specifically and clearly. Therefore, we use Trello as a management tool for each teamwork. Each team member will be marked with a specific color. Each week the team leader creates a Trello card with each person's name and color tag on the menu to identify each task to be completed for that week. To present the commission's stage, each Trello board will create four columns that are the commission has not yet started, the mission is in process, the task is completed, and the job is pending. After the task is completed, each member of the group can move the card to the column accordingly.
                <br/><br/>
                Outside the project, each member has to handle many other tasks. So our team agreed to devote a four-day week to the project. Three days is individually working for people to complete the assigned work on the Trello board by themselves. Each member will register with the team leader what is their 3-day working time. We use Slack as the team's primary communication tool, so at the beginning of each working-day, members have to post on the slack channel what they will do during the day for the project management and everyone on the team to understand others work-schedule. We choose every Saturday to meet face to face. The meeting is the most crucial meeting of the week, so it requires everyone to be presented. The meeting's main content is to review all the tasks that people have done in the past week, also identify which mission has been completed, how many percentages have been completed, which duties have not been completed, and which task has been delayed. Since then, the group members help each other come up with the solutions to their problems. At the same time, we also discuss the work that needs to be finished next week. We always prioritize meeting face to face every Saturday, but if there are members who can't go offline that day, we choose Teams to meet online because of Teams' transmission stability.
                <br/><br/>
                The personality and working style of each member is different. Mai and Quyen are dynamic and critical people. The numbers and proven data only convince them. Therefore, to persuade them in group discussions, other members will have to make reasonable arguments and data to support them. In contrast, Long and Loi are the silent ones, so we will actively pose questions to Long and Loi during group discussions. All members agreed to study and carefully prepare ideas and action plans before attending the Saturday face to face meeting every week.
                <br/><br/>
                If a team member doesn't respond to communication, the team leader will first try to contact that member in many ways to find out the inactive reason. Then discuss with the group to come up with solutions to help the member if they feel the work is tedious, the job is too complicated, or they are not sure what to do. After that, we will continue to observe that member. If we do not see a progressive change, we will consider removing them from the group.
                <br/><br/>
                Also, we agree to encourage an open environment for everyone to raise their problems, not only at work but also in everyday life. Team leaders are letting the team know they are available to discuss work projects, goals, and anything else.
