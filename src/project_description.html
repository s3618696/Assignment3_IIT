              <!-- Loi: Overview -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Overview (Loi)</h2>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Overview</h4>
              <p>
                Welcome to the Home Growth application project. We can see that people are gradually becoming aware of protecting the environment and also enhancing the importance of environmental protection present days. Therefore, many residential buildings have the appearance of many trees gradually bringing many benefits to human health and the environment on earth. At the same time, due to concerns about food safety, many people also want a clean source of organic vegetables without the use of chemicals and plant protection. Or some people want to have a nice garden view from a balcony to a small area in the background which contains flowers, small trees but don’t have any knowledge about how to plant and how to take care of.
                <br/><br/>
                So, our team is looking for a green social app that uses inside artificial intelligence (AI) technology to make it easier for users in their cherished homes to grow vegetables. Use spaces for well-known suitable crops, apply new feeds to share, always know crop problems, track and push crop notifications. That application can therefore help a part access some knowledge of growing green vegetables in the city, simple, easy to do, and save on food costs. Simultaneously, users can take advantage of the free space for planting trees in the house. Just choose the vegetables or plants you want to grow, you'll have information about that plants with instructions and a number of conditions for growing, taking care of and nurturing for a certain time period. Thus if you plant the vegetable, it comes to a point after a while where it can be harvested and consumed.
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Motivation</h4>
               <p>
                As we all know, the world is experiencing the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Growing vegetables at home is met by individuals around the globe in the course of implementing social barriers or social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Moreover, due to food pollution and residues of pesticides, chemical fertilizers are also part of making people confused, not knowing how to choose vegetables and fruits to protect their health and family. Furthermore, you have no purpose to do anything because you finish your work soon or get bored during the weekends or need to find new hobbies. So in order to help with the need for clean vegetable cultivation or making a garden, we thought of doing this task to help individuals how to plant in a viable way, by which they would build enthusiasm for agriculture, improve well-being and secure the soil. In addition, they may be able to make a profit by selling their own plants, vegetables, fruits, building enthusiasm for agribusiness, and having sustainable financial resources in the future.
                <br/><br/>
                We have applied AI and automated the analysis of developments in green vegetables to facilitate access for users. At the same time, feedback from users is automatically received so that we can fix bugs and update new features to increase the customer experience.
                <br/><br/>
                The importance of project design applying vegetable or plant  growing guidelines is also evident in addressing indirectly current food problems as well as other issues such as famine, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in this year (2020). We give two specific times to make it clear that the indirect benefit of this application is during the period of the COVID-19 epidemic and during daily life.
                <br/><br/>
                During the period of the Covid-19 epidemic, you can save money due to food prices, especially green vegetables, increased unexpectedly for some countries, social distancing, and work from home or reduce your work. Moreover, you can store plenty of food and also you can create a cool green space for making effective stress reduction, good for your health, and help your body move during social distance. Furthermore, growing vegetables at home can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide needed to safeguard our green planet.
                <br/><br/>
                In daily life, the investment costs in growing vegetables at home are less, thereby being active in the daily source of clean vegetables. So not only do you not worry about your family's health problems and ensure that safe vegetables are always fresh, delicious, high-nutrition, but you also make effective use of your spare time.
                <br/><br/>
                Food issues, as well as environmental issues, are becoming very sensitive issues at the moment when both of these issues have a major impact on human life and this green planet is losing life. The creation of green applications, environmental technologies that help to reduce environmental problems and clean food are now being encouraged by many environmental charity organizations and companies. This brings many significant benefits when investing properly in the promotion and development of green technologies for the human well-being of the living environment.
               </p>
               <h4 class="entry-title">Landscape</h4>
               <p>
                At present, there are many similarities between products on the domestic vegetable market will be applications which help users to harvest their own plants by providing useful information on the methods of cultivation of different plants you want to grow and the clean vegetable growing system at home using the hydroponic method used in hydroponic truss and management software on a smartphone.
                <br/><br/>
                In Vietnam, application products that assist users in growing green trees are effective for agriculture, as are those that intend to have a home garden in the city. For example, the hydroponic vegetable growing system project, which operates automatically via smartphones for students and staff of the Vinh Long University of Technical Education, won the first prize at the Tran Dai Nghia Technical Innovation Contest 2018-2019 organized by Vinh Long Province (Đảm, 2020). Another is the hydroponic vegetable growing system project through the smartphone application of a group of 6 university students that won the third prize in the "Danang Runway Startup 2016" start-up idea contest (Hương, 2016). These two projects all have in common the application of the hydroponic system and the smartphone application. Moreover, the Gardroid application created by Dimitri De Kerf also helps users to approach how to grow vegetables and provide some information about vegetables through receiving data from the internet.
                <br/><br/>
                In our project, it will be a little different from other projects to extend the effect it brings. The first is that we use artificial intelligence to process information quickly and conveniently in our applications. Secondly, it applies to all types of household planting, not just hydroponic planting systems, and therefore we can only provide guidance for users to plant their trees, not to automate the entire process of irrigation or fertilization in the above-mentioned applications, which must be carried out with the sensors attached to the hydroponic system. And last but not least, you can share the experience of planting plants, small trees or vegetables, trading products, providing advice, asking questions from previous practitioners or crop experts, and commenting on other processes to help guide the correct process or other features such as other plants, fertilizers, and so on.
              </p>
              <!-- Loi: Aims -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Aims (Loi)</h2>
              <p>
                Our aim for this intended application is to help users grow and harvest at home easily and conveniently on the basis of fresh fruit and vegetables information and techniques for a clean food source or have a nice view of the garden, and also indirect for environmental protection. We want to help people have clean, safe food and avoid external agents such as chemicals and pests. At the same time, creating a new experience of growing vegetables, using time as appropriate, and an  indirect step towards restoring the Earth's environment. But in order to achieve this, we need to break down a lot of small goals. Specific is data collection and analysis, simple and easy-to-use metrics, early-access version opening, official release.
                <br/><br/>
                First, we will gather data on the 1000 most popular gardening crops and start a training model based on this data. Also, collect data on the weather conditions and times most appropriate for these crops in order to assess the suitability of the user site for the growth of the selected crops. Finally, collect weather data for the country or city in which you live to increase the specificity, ease of data exploration. Typical example is a search for "home garden" in 54 US states over the past 12 months from Google Trends. Collection of data specifically to analyze data and to compare weather data with specific plants quickly and in less time.
                <br/><br/>
                Second, we want to create a simple, easy-to-use application that will be evaluated through a testing process in order to avoid being too simple or too fussy. After that, we will open an early access version for users to experience first and to be able to provide feedback. From it,  we'll adjust, fix bugs, and update new changes before the application officially opens. And finally, we need to promote this application to reach 5000 downloads after the release of the official version in order to proceed with the experience update. Also, we will create a network that is large enough for users to share their planting tips and products together as well as to deploy the gardening utensils recommendation features.
              </p>

              <!-- Mai: Plans and Progress -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Plans and Progress (Mai)</h2>

              <!-- Quyen: Roles -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Roles (Quyen)</h2>
              <p>
                It is important to define roles for particular participants in a project. The key to justifying a position is to demonstrate what task or responsibility is being covered. We have explicitly defined several works for the project, depending not only on the project's needs over each stage, but also on each team member's existing abilities, personality, and desired job.
                <br/><br/>
                • Project Management (Quyen): This position plays a crucial responsibility in the project, which is more tactical and strategic, focusing primarily on the execution side. In this project, we are expecting this position is not only holding three main activities, which are defined as risk and issue management, planning and resource scheduling, scope management. But also know how to set the vision for the product, gather requirements, and prioritize them. Quyen's current job is a web developer and a Project Management trainee. Moreover, Quyen's desired job is Technical Project Management, so we think it would be suitable for her to take the position.
                <br/><br/>
                • Business Analysis (Mai): The job is to work directly with users to determine problems and identify the user's needs. They work closely with the team to deliver user's perspectives and recommend viable solutions for meeting those needs. For this project, they are also required to handle user testing and the app's marketing. Mai wants to be a Business Analyst in the future. She has studied and has been in contact with marketing a lot. Therefore, Mai's ability to communicate with customers stands out the most in the group. Mai's personality is also meticulous and detailed. So the Business Analyst position is very suitable for Mai to undertake.
                <br/><br/>
                • Loi and Long have many outstanding personalities such as friendly, responsible, and dedicated to their work. However, for this project, Loi and Long may not be skilled enough to solve the project's technology-related problems as they seem to have only finished about one to two semesters at school, and have not learned or had practical contact with skills such as code in the web, mobile app or data, etc. Furthermore, Loi's ideal job is IT Security Analyst, so Loi may not commit to a project that requires development to last several years. Long's preferred position is Software development. Although he cannot directly participate in the tech parts of the product, this will be a perfect opportunity to interact with real projects and understand all the essential factors for a technology product to be born. We see that Long and Loi will be very suitable to accompany the project in tasks such as observing, researching, contributing ideas to the product team, and managing user testing.
                <br/><br/>
                Due to the complexity and the needs of the project, we expect to hire the following positions:
                <br/><br/>
                • Chief Technology Officer (CTO): The position is considered one of the most substantial technical knowledge for front-end, back-end, and AI. The CTO is responsible for maintaining the project's strategic logic focus and is in charge of turning a concept into reality. They manage the tech team and make business-critical tech decisions, such as tech design planning, product architecture layout, and development platform selection. If a tech team does not have the knowledge or resources to complete a task, it is down to the CTO to find a solution.
                <br/><br/>
                • UX, UI Designer: The project's primary purpose is to provide clear and beautiful guidance for users to grow their plants at home. It requires a UX designer to ensure a product makes sense to the user by creating a path that logically flows from one step to the next. A UI designer ensures each page visually communicates that path. They need to work closely with the product team, especially with the product analysis, to understand the users' needs and solve problems.
                <br/><br/>
                • Data Processing: This app is running mainly on AI. Therefore, it is essential to collect a massive amount of data and convert it into usable information. They are responsible for researching reliable data sources, crawling data from the authorities, and cleaning the data before sending it to the data scientist.
                <br/><br/>
                • Data Scientist: They communicate and collaborate with both the product team and the tech team. They must stay on top of analytical techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and text analytics. Using data from the data processing, they will build and run all data-driven models that solve the app's problems and finalize all API needed for mobile integration.
                <br/><br/>
                • Mobile Developer: They are required to build the app on both Android and IOS. They work closely with the back-end, the data scientist, and the product team to ensure all features work well.
                <br/><br/>
                • Back-end Developer: They are responsible for server-side development. They help to manage all activities that happen when performing any action on the app. Back-end developer focuses on databases, scripting, and the architecture of the app. The code written by them helps to communicate the database information. Specifically, they will build the store of data (plants database, user planting process, etc.) and ensure that it is displayed to that user who is supposed to access it. They manage API's resources that are needed for others.
                <br/><br/>
                • Technical Tester: They work as part of a development team and perform the functional and non-functional testing of the project using manual and automated testing techniques. They identify test conditions and create test designs, test cases, test procedure specifications, and test data. Finally, they provide reports to the project team about any issues or improvements that the product may require.

              <p>There are three stages for us to put into the production test.</p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 1</h4>
              <p>
                At this stage, we focus mainly on software testing technologies. A technical examiner or QA does most of the work at this stage. They will plan and execute software testing through six steps of the software testing process.
                <br/>
                • Step 1: <b>Analyzing requirements:</b> This step needs to research and analyze the requirements of the project
                <br/>
                • Step 2: <b>Test plan:</b> This step needs to define the scope of the project, determine the approach, identify resources, plan the design work test.
                <br/>
                • Step 3: <b>Develop test cases:</b> Review documents, write test cases, checklists, test prepare data, review test cases, checklists.
                <br/>
                • Step 4: <b>Setting up the environment:</b> Set up a test environment (server/client/network), check the test environment by smoke test.
                <br/>
                • Step 5: <b>Perform a test:</b> Perform a software test, Compare the expected results, and report the errors with the error management tool. Perform a check again to verify the error has been fixed. And regression testing when relevant changes. Measure and analyze progress. Adjust project documents according to the actual progress of the project. Report regularly to the Project Manager on the project implementation situation.
                <br/>
                • Step 6: <b>Test cycle closure:</b> Summarize, report results on test case execution. Evaluate fulfillment criteria such as testing scope, quality, cost, time, and critical business goals. Discuss and draw lessons from experience.
                <br/>
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 2</h4>
              <p>Focus primarily on internal testing. After the QA completes their testing, a mock-up product will be released, asking everyone in the product team, including PM, to install and test their device's mock-up version. QA collects all error feedback that is claimed from the PM and product team. Then review the bug, report it to developers to make corrections. </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 3</h4>
              <p>This is the phase that focuses mainly on user testing. BA and the product team mostly complete the works at this stage. They will provide methods to engage users in the use of the test products. There are many ways to gather users like seeding into the Facebook group for home care, growing trees at home such as "Yeu Bep," "Nghien Nha" etc. Target customers are between the ages of 20 and 50 who love planting trees and taking care of their families. Create a Facebook community to communicate and support users. Run advertising applications on the media. Organize seminars on new technologies applied in products to attract students and people who love AI technology applications. BA needs to collect, analyze, and report on user opinions.</p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">How We Know When The Product Succeed</h4>
              <p>Additionally, we will know the product's success if the feedback results from the user testing is more than 80% of users are happy using the app. Moreover, we will collect and analyze the application report from the google analytics (we will integrate the google analytics to the app since the stage of launching. Google analytics is a great tool integrated for an application which allows us to know how many users are using the app, what stage that users are leaving the app, and providing actionable insights, ect.). Therefore, from those reports, we might have the efficient data to consider customizing the app to make the product more user friendly.</p>

              <!-- Quyen: Group Prcesses and Communications -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Group Processes and Communications (Quyen)</h2>
              <p>
                It is common for everyone to work together in small groups, teams, and departments to accomplish specific tasks in a university environment and real working life. To work effectively with one another, each individual needs to have strong group communication skills. If they don't, the team members may cause misunderstandings, start unnecessary conflicts, and slow down a team's effectiveness. A plan to facilitate effective group communication can help everyone work better together. Therefore, below is our agreement in the group processes and the way we communicate with each other.
                <br/><br/>
                Trello is an excellent tool for teamwork management. Looking at the Trello board, members will quickly grasp the work progress of themselves and all members of the team. Trello allows users to create work notes on each card, helping the project managers manage and assign tasks to each member specifically and clearly. Therefore, we use Trello as a management tool for each teamwork. Each team member will be marked with a specific color. Each week the team leader creates a Trello card with each person's name and color tag on the menu to identify each task to be completed for that week. To present the commission's stage, each Trello board will create four columns that the commission has not yet started, the mission is in process, the task is completed, and the job is pending. After the task is completed, each member of the group can move the card to the column accordingly.
                <br/><br/>
                Outside the project, each member has to handle many other tasks. So our team agreed to devote a four-day week to the project. Three days is individually working for people to complete the assigned work on the Trello board by themselves. Each member will register with the team leader what is their 3-day working time. We use Slack as the team's primary communication tool, so at the beginning of each working-day, members have to post on the slack channel what they will do during the day for the project management and everyone on the team understand-work schedule. We choose every Saturday to meet face to face. The meeting is the most crucial meeting of the week, so it requires everyone on the team to be presented. The conference's main content is to review all the tasks that people have done in the past week, which mission has been completed, how many percentages have been completed, which duties have not been completed, and which task has been delayed. Since then, the group members help each other come up with solutions to their problems. At the same time, we agree that the work needs to be finished next week. We always prioritize meeting face to face every Saturday, but if there are members who can't go offline that day, we choose Teams to meet online because of Teams' transmission stability.
                <br/><br/>
                The personality and working style of each member is different. Mai and Quyen are dynamic and critical people. The numbers and proven data only convince them. Therefore, to persuade them in group discussions, other members will have to make reasonable arguments and data to support them. In contrast, Long and Loi are the silent ones, so we will actively pose questions to Long and Loi during group discussions. All members agreed to study and carefully prepare ideas and action plans before attending the Saturday face to face meeting every week.
                <br/><br/>
                If a team member doesn't respond to communication, the team leader will first try to contact that member in many ways to find out the inactive reason. Then discuss with the group to come up with solutions to help the member if they feel the work is tedious, the job is too complicated, or they are not sure what to do. After that, we will continue to observe that member. If we do not see a progressive change, we will consider removing them from the group.
                <br/><br/>
                Also, we agree to encourage an open environment for everyone to raise their problems, not only at work but also in everyday life. Team leaders are letting the team know they are available to discuss work projects, goals, and anything else.
              </p>
