              <!-- Quyen: Roles -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Roles</h2>
              <p>
                It is important to define roles for particular participants in a project. The key to justifying a position is to demonstrate what task or responsibility is being covered. We have explicitly defined several works for the project, depending not only on the project's needs over each stage, but also on each team member's existing abilities, personality, and desired job.
                <br/>
                • Project Management (Quyen): This position plays a crucial responsibility in the project, which is more tactical and strategic, focusing primarily on the execution side. In this project, we are expecting this position is not only holding three main activities, which are defined as risk and issue management, planning and resource scheduling, scope management. But also know how to set the vision for the product, gather requirements, and prioritize them. Quyen's current job is a web developer and a Project Management trainee. Moreover, Quyen's desired job is Technical Project Management, so we think it would be suitable for her to take the position.
                <br/>
                • Business Analysis (Mai): The job is to work directly with users to determine problems and identify the user's needs. They work closely with the team to deliver user's perspectives and recommend viable solutions for meeting those needs. For this project, they are also required to handle user testing and the app's marketing. Mai wants to be a Business Analyst in the future. She has studied and has been in contact with marketing a lot. Therefore, Mai's ability to communicate with customers stands out the most in the group. Mai's personality is also meticulous and detailed. So the Business Analyst position is very suitable for Mai to undertake.
                <br/>
                • Loi and Long have many outstanding personalities such as friendly, responsible, and dedicated to their work. However, for this project, Loi and Long may not be skilled enough to solve the project's technology-related problems as they seem to have only finished about one to two semesters at school, and have not learned or had practical contact with skills such as code in the web, mobile app or data, etc. Furthermore, Loi's ideal job is IT Security Analyst, so Loi may not commit to a project that requires development to last several years. Long's preferred position is Software development. Although he cannot directly participate in the tech parts of the product, this will be a perfect opportunity to interact with real projects and understand all the essential factors for a technology product to be born. We see that Long and Loi will be very suitable to accompany the project in tasks such as observing, researching, contributing ideas to the product team, and managing user testing.
                <br/>
                Due to the complexity and the needs of the project, we expect to hire the following positions:
