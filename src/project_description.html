              <p>
                Loi Part in Here

              <!-- Quyen: Roles -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Roles</h2>
              <p>
                It is important to define roles for particular participants in a project. The key to justifying a position is to demonstrate what task or responsibility is being covered. We have explicitly defined several works for the project, depending not only on the project's needs over each stage, but also on each team member's existing abilities, personality, and desired job.
                <br/><br/>
                • Project Management (Quyen): This position plays a crucial responsibility in the project, which is more tactical and strategic, focusing primarily on the execution side. In this project, we are expecting this position is not only holding three main activities, which are defined as risk and issue management, planning and resource scheduling, scope management. But also know how to set the vision for the product, gather requirements, and prioritize them. Quyen's current job is a web developer and a Project Management trainee. Moreover, Quyen's desired job is Technical Project Management, so we think it would be suitable for her to take the position.
                <br/><br/>
                • Business Analysis (Mai): The job is to work directly with users to determine problems and identify the user's needs. They work closely with the team to deliver user's perspectives and recommend viable solutions for meeting those needs. For this project, they are also required to handle user testing and the app's marketing. Mai wants to be a Business Analyst in the future. She has studied and has been in contact with marketing a lot. Therefore, Mai's ability to communicate with customers stands out the most in the group. Mai's personality is also meticulous and detailed. So the Business Analyst position is very suitable for Mai to undertake.
                <br/><br/>
                • Loi and Long have many outstanding personalities such as friendly, responsible, and dedicated to their work. However, for this project, Loi and Long may not be skilled enough to solve the project's technology-related problems as they seem to have only finished about one to two semesters at school, and have not learned or had practical contact with skills such as code in the web, mobile app or data, etc. Furthermore, Loi's ideal job is IT Security Analyst, so Loi may not commit to a project that requires development to last several years. Long's preferred position is Software development. Although he cannot directly participate in the tech parts of the product, this will be a perfect opportunity to interact with real projects and understand all the essential factors for a technology product to be born. We see that Long and Loi will be very suitable to accompany the project in tasks such as observing, researching, contributing ideas to the product team, and managing user testing.
                <br/><br/>
                Due to the complexity and the needs of the project, we expect to hire the following positions:
                <br/><br/>
                • Chief Technology Officer (CTO): The position is considered one of the most substantial technical knowledge for front-end, back-end, and AI. The CTO is responsible for maintaining the project's strategic logic focus and is in charge of turning a concept into reality. They manage the tech team and make business-critical tech decisions, such as tech design planning, product architecture layout, and development platform selection. If a tech team does not have the knowledge or resources to complete a task, it is down to the CTO to find a solution. 
                <br/><br/>
                • UX, UI Designer: The project's primary purpose is to provide clear and beautiful guidance for users to grow their plants at home. It requires a UX designer to ensure a product makes sense to the user by creating a path that logically flows from one step to the next. A UI designer ensures each page visually communicates that path. They need to work closely with the product team, especially with the product analysis, to understand the users' needs and solve problems.
                <br/><br/>
                • Data Processing: This app is running mainly on AI. Therefore, it is essential to collect a massive amount of data and convert it into usable information. They are responsible for researching reliable data sources, crawling data from the authorities, and cleaning the data before sending it to the data scientist.
                <br/><br/>
                • Data Scientist: They communicate and collaborate with both the product team and the tech team. They must stay on top of analytical techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and text analytics. Using data from the data processing, they will build and run all data-driven models that solve the app's problems and finalize all API needed for mobile integration.
                <br/><br/>
                • Mobile Developer: They are required to build the app on both Android and IOS. They work closely with the back-end, the data scientist, and the product team to ensure all features work well.
                <br/><br/>
                • Back-end Developer: They are responsible for server-side development. They help to manage all activities that happen when performing any action on the app. Back-end developer focuses on databases, scripting, and the architecture of the app. The code written by them helps to communicate the database information. Specifically, they will build the store of data (plants database, user planting process, etc.) and ensure that it is displayed to that user who is supposed to access it. They manage API's resources that are needed for others.
                <br/><br/>
                • Technical Tester: They work as part of a development team and perform the functional and non-functional testing of the project using manual and automated testing techniques. They identify test conditions and create test designs, test cases, test procedure specifications, and test data. Finally, they provide reports to the project team about any issues or improvements that the product may require.

              <!-- Quyen: Testing -->
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Testing</h2>
              <p>There are three stages for us to put into the production test.</p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 1</h4>
              <p>
                At this stage, we focus mainly on software testing technologies. A technical examiner or QA does most of the work at this stage. They will plan and execute software testing through six steps of the software testing process.
                <br/>
                • Step 1: <b>Analyzing requirements:</b> This step needs to research and analyze the requirements of the project
                <br/>
                • Step 2: <b>Test plan:</b> This step needs to define the scope of the project, determine the approach, identify resources, plan the design work test.
                <br/>
                • Step 3: <b>Develop test cases:</b> Review documents, write test cases, checklists, test prepare data, review test cases, checklists.
                <br/>
                • Step 4: <b>Setting up the environment:</b> Set up a test environment (server/client/network), check the test environment by smoke test.
                <br/>
                • Step 5: <b>Perform a test:</b> Perform a software test, Compare the expected results, and report the errors with the error management tool. Perform a check again to verify the error has been fixed. And regression testing when relevant changes. Measure and analyze progress. Adjust project documents according to the actual progress of the project. Report regularly to the Project Manager on the project implementation situation.
                <br/>
                • Step 6: <b>Test cycle closure:</b> Summarize, report results on test case execution. Evaluate fulfillment criteria such as testing scope, quality, cost, time, and critical business goals. Discuss and draw lessons from experience.
                <br/>
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 2</h4>
              <p>Focus primarily on internal testing. After the QA completes their testing, a mock-up product will be released, asking everyone in the product team, including PM, to install and test their device's mock-up version. QA collects all error feedback that is claimed from the PM and product team. Then review the bug, report it to developers to make corrections. </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Stage 3</h4>
              <p>This is the phase that focuses mainly on user testing. BA and the product team mostly complete the works at this stage. They will provide methods to engage users in the use of the test products. There are many ways to gather users like seeding into the Facebook group for home care, growing trees at home such as "Yeu Bep," "Nghien Nha" etc. Target customers are between the ages of 20 and 50 who love planting trees and taking care of their families. Create a Facebook community to communicate and support users. Run advertising applications on the media. Organize seminars on new technologies applied in products to attract students and people who love AI technology applications. BA needs to collect, analyze, and report on user opinions.</p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">How We Know When The Product Succeed</h4>
              <p>Additionally, we will know the product's success if the feedback results from the user testing is more than 80% of users are happy using the app. Moreover, we will collect and analyze the application report from the google analytics (we will integrate the google analytics to the app since the stage of launching. Google analytics is a great tool integrated for an application which allows us to know how many users are using the app, what stage that users are leaving the app, and providing actionable insights, ect.). Therefore, from those reports, we might have the efficient data to consider customizing the app to make the product more user friendly.</p>
